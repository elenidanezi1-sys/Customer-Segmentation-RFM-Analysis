# Identifying Customer Value with RFM Analysis 📊

## Why this project?
Data is useless if you can't act on it. In this project, I took a raw dataset of 500,000+ transactions and transformed it into a clear roadmap for marketing. By using the **RFM model** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), I answered three critical questions for any business owner:
1. Who are my best customers?
2. Who is about to leave?
3. Where should I spend my marketing budget to get the best return?

## The Logic Behind the Analysis
Instead of just running a script, I followed a specific business-driven workflow:
* **Data Integrity:** Cleaned the dataset by removing cancellations and missing IDs to ensure the scores reflect real revenue.
* **Segmenting for Strategy:** I didn't just give numbers. I grouped customers into categories like **VIPs**, **Loyals**, and **At Risk**.
* **Actionable Insights:** The goal was to produce a list of "At Risk" customers that a business can immediately use for a "Win-back" email campaign.

## Tools & Skills
* **Python (Pandas):** For data manipulation and metric calculation.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For creating the "rfm_analysis_chart" chart.

> **Analyst's Note:** Looking at the distribution, the 'At Risk' segment is surprisingly large. 
> This represents a significant amount of "lost revenue" that can be recovered. 
> Instead of just looking at the numbers, I recommend the business starts with a 
> 'Win-Back' email campaign targeting this specific group to test their responsiveness.
* **Business Intelligence:** Applying statistical quartiles to real-world sales data.

## Key Takeaway
The analysis revealed that while the 'Loyal' segment is healthy, there is a significant 'At Risk' group. **My recommendation:** Before spending more on Facebook ads to find new customers, the business should focus on a re-engagement offer for this specific group.
